								<h4>Online Gait Analyis</h4>
								<p>A gait analysis provides key information about the way you run, and helps runners to choose the right type of shoe for their running gait, both optimising performance and reducing the risk of injury.</p>
								</b>

								<h4>Submitting Your Video</h4>
								<p>To submit your video for online gait analysis:
								</b>
								<ul>
								<li>Capture a 15-20 second video of yourself running on a treadmill. </li>
								<li>Position and center the camera approximately 12-18 inches behind the treadmill and approximately 4-8 inches off of the ground. If you lack a tripod, a running shoe box is the ideal height.</li>
								<li>If the runner has multiple pairs of shoes, have them wear the least supportive pair they own.</li>
								<li>Capture an approximately 15-20 second video of the athlete running on a treadmill making sure to record the runner from behind at approximately treadmill level.</li>
								<li>The video should have the runner centered on the screen displaying a clear view of each foot as it lands and continues through to toe off. Record the athlete running at a pace that is close to their normal training pace.</li>
								<li>The video needs to be under 300MB and one of the following file types: .avi .mov .mpeg or .wmv</li>
								<li>Name your video file to include your first and last name.</li>
								<li>Click the "Submit Your Video" button below to upload your video.</li>
								<li>Please include your name, email address and the specific make and model of the shoe you are wearing during the filming of the video.</li>
								<li>Include any additional details such as your typical weekly mileage, history of running injuries, and upcoming training or racing goals.</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Analysis</h4>
								<p>Our specialist will analyse your video footage, assess your gait to establish your level of pronation and identify any biomechanical inefficiencies which might be impacting on your performance. </p>

								<p>We'll analyse your gait frame by frame throughout your footstrike, from the landing phase throughout to toe off, identifying both your level of pronation and your individual footstrike pattern. From this we can identify whether you are an overpronator, a neutral runner, or if you underpronate.
								</p>
								<h4>Recomendation</h4>
								<p>Having assessed your video footage, our specialist will feedback their findings, including a detailed analysis of your running gait, and our recommendations as to the best type of running shoe for you - along with any additional suggestions we feel might be useful. We're also happy to answer any further questions you might have - by email or give us a call<p>
