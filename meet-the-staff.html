								<h2>Drew Conner</h2>
								<p>Hey guys, my name is Drew Conner. I had a very successful cross country and track career during my tenure at Fayetteville High School before graduating in 2004. I attended the University of Central Arkansas in Conway, Arkansas. I led the team there for five years before graduating with my Bachelor's Degree in dietetics in 2009. I want to use my skills and experiences as a runner to help others get into the sport that I love. I also want to use my knowledge of nutrition to help others achieve their weight and health goals whether they be running/walking related or not. Diet and exercise can be two of the most difficult things to do successfully on your own, so don't be afraid to ask what may seem like the most simple questions about one or the other.

								<h2>Keri Letson</h2>
								<p>Hi!  My name is Keri Letson.  I was born and raised in a tiny little town in Southwest Missouri called Ash Grove.  I moved to Bentonville when I married my husband almost 20 years ago.  I love this great community we live in!  

								I ran for my high school track team,  but stopped running when I went to college.   I took up running again in 2008, but it was sporadic.   

								Until I stumbled across a sign-up for this newly formed half marathon training group, administered by Mike Rush, that Bentonville Parks and Rec was starting.   I signed up on a whim and ran my first half marathon in the Spring of 2012.  After that,  I was hooked on running!   I've run several half and full marathons since then and hope to qualify to run the Boston Marathon someday! 

								I am so excited to be a part of the Rush Running family so I can pay it forward by helping people reach their running, walking, or healthy lifestyle goals. Stop by the store and say Hi anytime!

								<h2>Lane Schulte</h2>
								<p>Hey ya'll! My name is Lane and I'm new to the Rush Running squad. I'm from Kansas City but moved to Fayetteville just three short years ago to start calling the hogs. I first fell in love with running as a seventh grader when I joined my school's cross country team. My desire to improve was what drove me to keep running in high school, but in high school I learned it was my love for my team and the sport that kept me going all these years. After running mostly 5K's in high school, I'd like to run a half within the next year, but right now my main goal is to increase my mileage without making myself hate the training process. When I'm not running I love to hike, sleep, go to the lake, and eat Andy's Frozen Custard (I could live off of double Oreo concretes). I am also an aspiring physical therapist, and I'm hoping to get accepted to a program and start school in August of 2016. If you want to know anything else about me, feel free to stalk me on social media (you know you want to).</p>

								<h2>Nathan Sellars </h2>
								<p>Hey there! My name is Nathan Sellars. I was born in Layton Utah, a small suburb located not far from the capitol of the beehive state (Salt Lake City). It is there that I discovered my passion for the mountains, the cold weather, and Classic Rock!  I currently run Cross Country at Bentonville High School.  I have been running for a little over five years now and I am building up my endurance in order to run my first full length marathon. I began running in the seventh grade at Washington Jr. High school.  Since then, I have grown from being one of the slowest members on the team who finished well behind the pack in numerous races, to becoming a more experienced runner who has finished in the top three places of my age group in recent half marathons.

								<h2>Stuart Jackson</h2>
								<p>Hey there, my name is Stuart Jackson. I was born and raised in Jenks, Oklahoma (Go Trojans!). I started running in the 6th grade when I joined Jenks America Track Club. At first, I didn't really get it. It was painful and I didn't really enjoy it. I stuck with it though, and fell in love with the sport and the challenge it provided. I've been running ever since! I ran competitively in middle school and high school and still try to run as fast as I can. I also enjoy spending time doing other outdoor activities such as backpacking and rock-climbing. I worked as a whitewater rafting guide in Colorado on the Arkansas River.  I graduated from the University of Arkansas (Go Hogs!) in 2014 with a degree in Business Economics. I like working at Rush Running because it gives me the opportunity to share my passion for running with others. If I could have one superpower, it would be the ability to fly.</p>

								<h2>Kesley Brown</h2>
								<p>Hey my name is Kesley! When I was 8, my parents realized that my constant running of laps around the neighborhood was starting to scare the neighbors, so they signed me up for AAU Track & Field. The first couple of years I only did sprinting and long jump, but my coach had an eye for a distance runner, so to distance training I went. After I realized that it was humanly possible to run multiple miles at one time, I learned to really enjoy distance running. I kept running through middle school cross country/ track, and eventually on to cross country/ track at Rogers Heritage High School. Now I am a senior at Heritage, and I have had the honor to experience a cross country state win with my great team, along with two runner-up finishes. Although I don't plan to run competitively in college, I know I will continue to run for the rest of my life!

								<p>Hi! My name is Heather. I am from Branson, Missouri where I played basketball, softball, and ran track. I was a sprinter and part of the 4x400 relay team placing at the state meet each year; however, my real love was basketball. I then joined the Southeast Missouri Redhawks, a division I basketball team in Cape Girardeau, Missouri during college.

Most importantly, I received a degree in Human Environmental Studies and Pre Architecture while at South East Missouri. I have been a part of the Rush Running team since 2011. I now enjoy the ultra distances, and recently completed my longest run yet at 50 miles with the support of the Rush team! I enjoy any type of outdoor activity and staying fit.

								<p>I liked Rush Running so much as a customer and race team member that I decided it only made sense to make Mike & Ali pay me. So here I am. And I have appointed myself the Director of Fun. I’ve been running in some form or fashion ever since I was a kid. Back in the days before iPhones, X-box and the like. You know, when our parents told us to go outside and play. Sure, I’ve taken breaks from time to time (the longest about 10 years) but I always come back to running. Pavement or dirt, road or trail, 1 mile to 50 miles. It doesn’t matter to me. The longer I have run the more I realize what a gift it is. One passed to me from my father. My mission is to pass it on to others. That’s why I’m here. Here are my rules… 
								<div />
								1. No grouchy pants allowed<div />
								2. Keep it simple<div />
								3. Be kind to everyone<div />

								<h2>John Lamparski</h2>
								<p>My name is John Lamparski.  I also work for the Bentonville CVB and was part of the original group that helped to plan the first Bentonville Half Marathon.  I mentioned that someone from our office should run the Half and when nobody raised their hand, I was volunteered.  Now, I have spent most of my life avoiding running.  Unless I was being chased, you would never find me moving quickly.  But during the initial training for the first half, I found a love for running.  Now 2 full’s, 13 half’s and countless local, smaller races and I am still going strong.  I will never win a race, but I will be the guy in the middle of the pack smiling as he crosses the finish line.
 								<div />
								I work weekends at Rush Running and I enjoy helping all the local runners.  From experts to beginners, I will do whatever I can to answer your questions  and make sure you have fun while you are shopping.  Stop by one weekend and say hi.

My love of running started when I was in the 3rd grade and I did the Girls on the Run program through most of elementary school. Fast forward to junior high, I started cross country and track. Thats also when I meet Mike Rush for the first time because I would go to the Monday speed sessions at the old tiger track with a few of my friends after school. He always gave me a hard time about smiling while I was running hahaha. I am hoping to attend college to study environmental science and to hopefully run cross country.

								<p>Hey guys! My name is Megan Dickard, and I come from right here in Northwest Arkansas. My love for running began when I was a freshman in high school. I quit the basketball team, and joined cross country on a whim, ever since then there's been no turning back. I love challenging myself to run personal bests in 5ks, and my current best is a 20:53. However I would love to one day work up to a half or even full marathon! I'm currently a senior in high school at Har-Ber High, where I am on the varsity cross country and track team, and have had a very successful career so far. Not only do I love competing in school sanctioned events, but I love to run in local 5ks as well!

								<h2>Trae Etheredge</h2>
								<p>Born during the wonderful month of March in Hog country, I Trae Etheredge entered the world as possibly the coolest guy ever. But of course that could be debatable. Running for me started in the 7th grade and being the slowest kid on the team my future in running didn't look very bright. With the help of a wonderful Christian man named Preston Barrett that barrier of being the slowest kid on the team didn't stand in my way. I managed to run 17:15 in the 5k and run a 50 mile race with my dad at the age of 15. Lets just say coach wasn't very happy that Monday afternoon even though I managed to run a 6 minute mile 36 hours after running 50 miles. I’ve managed to run several marathons in back to back days with a gentleman named Trent Morrow whom is the World Record holder for the most number of marathons in a consecutive year. Why I thought that was a good idea I have no clue. I absolutely love running, it has become a lifestyle for me as should with anyone else I believe that finds it enjoyable. I’m always down for a good run with anyone and everyone. Along side running I enjoy playing my cello at the University of Arkansas. Winter months are spent in the tree stand seeking out the biggest buck in the world, which has yet to happen. Summer months are spent casting my rod and reel trying to lure in that 12lb bass. Anytime your in the neighborhood stop by Rush Running Company and I will be more than happy to talk about running, or anything at all. You may be able to lure me into a few miles too.
